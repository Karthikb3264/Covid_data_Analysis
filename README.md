# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## ðŸ“Š Overview
This project focuses on analyzing global COVID-19 data to uncover trends, visualize the spread, and identify key insights related to cases, deaths, and recoveries across different countries and time periods.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook 
- **Visualization**: Static plots and interactive dashboards

## ðŸ“Œ Key Objectives
- Clean and preprocess COVID-19 data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends by country, date, and continent
- Identify peak periods and calculate growth rates
- Create interactive maps and charts to track cases over time

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- Top 10 countries by confirmed cases and deaths
- Daily and cumulative trend analysis
- Case fatality rate (CFR) comparisons
- Country-wise recovery and active case rates
- Impact of lockdowns and vaccination rollouts (optional)

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations
- Line charts: Daily new cases, deaths, and recoveries
- Bar charts: Top countries by total cases and deaths
- Heatmaps: Correlation between variables
- Choropleth map: Case distribution across the world

## ðŸ’¡ Future Enhancements
- Integrate live API data updates
- Add vaccination and testing data
- Deploy dashboard using Streamlit or Tableau
